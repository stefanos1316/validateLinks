# About validateLinks

A repository with purpose on reporting if the existing links in a user's repository, local directory, or a givne link are valid.

Our mission here is to provide a tool that can check if the links found, not only in html documents but any kind of, in different documents are not broken. 
Also, we extend the features of our tool to perform First Depth Search (FDS) to identify even more links found under tree directories.
The tool can report its results in a terminal or in a form of email reports giving the descriptive analysis and an overall report. 


# Dependencies

* Install lynx command for --link option

# Try it out

Use -h or --help to see all the command line arguments for the tool's usage. It can be used to validate links from different directories, projects, or online links.
